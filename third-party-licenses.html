    <br/>We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public domain. An individual or company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.<br/>We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system and expect to make other tools available as they are completed.<br/>
    <br/>In countries where the Public Domain status of the work may not be valid, the author grants a copyright licence to the general public to deal in the work without restriction and permission to sublicence derivates under the terms of any (OSI approved) Open Source licence.<hr/>

    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.<br/>5.

    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.

If You<br/>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br/>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/>
    <br/>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br/>      meet the following conditions:<br/>

    <br/>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>          the Derivative Works; and<br/>
    <br/>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/>          as modifying the License.<br/>
    <br/>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>      the conditions stated in this License.<br/>
    <br/>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>
    <br/>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/>
    <br/>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/>
    <br/>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/>
    <br/>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/>

A note on JAXP
-----------------------

Since Java 1.4, JAXP (Java API for XML Processing) is part of the 
JRE/JDK. Every JVM includes the APIs and an implementation. However, 
older JREs often contain implementations with bugs that are triggered 
by code in Apache FOP and therefore need to be overridden. Now, since 
JAXP is part of the class library, special precautions are necessary 
to replace the original implementations. This is not done by simply 
adding new JARs to the classpath as these classes would never be 
loaded (due to Java's class loader hierarchy). 

Replacing the default implementations involves understanding the 
"Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism".
More information can be found here:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/standards/index.html

See also:
http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/faq.html#faq-N100EF

Essentially, you have two different possibilities:
- add the replacement JARs in the jre/lib/endorsed directory of your JRE.
- Use the -Xbootclasspath/p: option when starting the JVM (may not be
  available for every JVM).

For the purposes<br/>      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br/>      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br/>      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br/>

    <br/>   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br/>      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br/>      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br/>      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br/>      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br/>      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br/>      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br/>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br/>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/>
    <br/>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br/>      meet the following conditions:<br/>

    <br/>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/>          as modifying the License.<br/>
    <br/>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>      the conditions stated in this License.<br/>
    <br/>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>
    <br/>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/>
    <br/>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/>
    <br/>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/>
    <br/>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/>

in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.

NO WARRANTY

The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
research and development conducted during the project and is provided
to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein

the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
any right of any third party.

the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.

Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other

In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted

    <br/>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>
    <br/>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/>

    <br/>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/>

    <br/>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>          the Derivative Works; and<br/>
    <br/>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/>          as modifying the License.<br/>
    <br/>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>      the conditions stated in this License.<br/>
    <br/>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>
    <br/>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/>
    <br/>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/>
    <br/>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/>
    <br/>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/>

    <br/>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>          stating that You changed the files; and<br/>
    <br/>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>          the Derivative Works; and<br/>
    <br/>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/>          as modifying the License.<br/>
    <br/>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>      the conditions stated in this License.<br/>

Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>
    <br/>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/>

Unless required by applicable law or<br/>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/>

In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/>
    <br/>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>      License.

    <strong>License text(s):&nbsp;</strong>
    <br/>  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br/>
    <br/> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br/>the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br/>License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br/>
    <br/>  0. Additional Definitions.<br/>
    <br/>  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br/>General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br/>General Public License.<br/>
    <br/>  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br/>other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br/>
    <br/>  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br/>by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br/>Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br/>of using an interface provided by the Library.<br/>
    <br/>  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br/>Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<br/>with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br/>Version".<br/>
    <br/>  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br/>Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br/>for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br/>based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br/>
    <br/>  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br/>object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br/>and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br/>Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br/>
    <br/>  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br/>
    <br/>  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br/>without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br/>
    <br/>  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br/>
    <br/>  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br/>facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br/>that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br/>facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br/>version:<br/>
    <br/>   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br/>   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br/>   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br/>   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br/>
    <br/>   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br/>   this License applicable to that copy.<br/>
    <br/>  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br/>
    <br/>  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br/>a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<br/>code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br/>material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br/>layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br/>(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br/>
    <br/>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br/>   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br/>   covered by this License.<br/>
    <br/>   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br/>   document.<br/>
    <br/>  4. Combined Works.<br/>
    <br/>  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br/>taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br/>portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br/>engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br/>the following:<br/>
    <br/>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br/>   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br/>   covered by this License.<br/>
    <br/>   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br/>   document.<br/>
    <br/>   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br/>   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br/>   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br/>   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br/>
    <br/>   d) Do one of the following:<br/>
    <br/>       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br/>       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br/>       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br/>       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br/>       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br/>       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br/>       Corresponding Source.<br/>
    <br/>       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br/>       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br/>       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br/>       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br/>       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br/>       Version.<br/>
    <br/>   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br/>   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br/>   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br/>   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br/>   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br/>   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br/>   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br/>   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br/>   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br/>   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br/>   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br/>
    <br/>  5. Combined Libraries.<br/>
    <br/>  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br/>Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br/>facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br/>License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br/>choice, if you do both of the following:<br/>
    <br/>   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br/>   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br/>   conveyed under the terms of this License.<br/>
    <br/>   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br/>   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br/>   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br/>
    <br/>  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br/>
    <br/>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br/>of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br/>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br/>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br/>
    <br/>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br/>Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br/>of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br/>applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br/>conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br/>published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br/>received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br/>General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br/>General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br/>
    <br/>  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br/>whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br/>apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br/>permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br/>Library.<br/>

    <br/>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br/>
    <br/>1. DEFINITIONS<br/>
    <br/>"Contribution" means:<br/>
    <br/>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<br/>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br/>i) changes to the Program, and<br/>ii) additions to the Program;<br/>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.<br/>"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.<br/>
    <br/>"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.<br/>
    <br/>"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.<br/>
    <br/>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.<br/>
    <br/>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br/>
    <br/>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.<br/>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br/>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.<br/>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br/>3. REQUIREMENTS<br/>
    <br/>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:<br/>
    <br/>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br/>b) its license agreement:<br/>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<br/>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br/>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br/>iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.<br/>When the Program is made available in source code form:<br/>
    <br/>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br/>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.<br/>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.<br/>
    <br/>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.<br/>
    <br/>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br/>
    <br/>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br/>
    <br/>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.<br/>
    <br/>5. NO WARRANTY<br/>
    <br/>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br/>
    <br/>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br/>
    <br/>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
    <br/>7. GENERAL<br/>
    <br/>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br/>
    <br/>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/>
    <br/>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br/>
    <br/>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.<br/>
    <br/>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.<hr/>

    <br/>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br/>
    <br/>1. DEFINITIONS<br/>
    <br/>"Contribution" means:<br/>
    <br/>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<br/>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br/>i) changes to the Program, and<br/>ii) additions to the Program;<br/>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.<br/>"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.<br/>
    <br/>"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.<br/>
    <br/>"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.<br/>
    <br/>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.<br/>
    <br/>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br/>
    <br/>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.<br/>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br/>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.<br/>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br/>3. REQUIREMENTS<br/>
    <br/>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:<br/>
    <br/>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br/>b) its license agreement:<br/>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<br/>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br/>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br/>iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.<br/>When the Program is made available in source code form:<br/>
    <br/>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br/>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.<br/>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.<br/>
    <br/>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.<br/>
    <br/>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br/>
    <br/>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br/>
    <br/>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.<br/>
    <br/>5. NO WARRANTY<br/>
    <br/>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br/>
    <br/>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br/>
    <br/>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
    <br/>7. GENERAL<br/>
    <br/>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br/>
    <br/>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/>
    <br/>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br/>
    <br/>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.<br/>
    <br/>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.<br/>

    <br/>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br/>
    <br/>1. DEFINITIONS<br/>
    <br/>"Contribution" means:<br/>
    <br/>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<br/>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br/>i) changes to the Program, and<br/>ii) additions to the Program;<br/>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.<br/>"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.<br/>
    <br/>"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.<br/>
    <br/>"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.<br/>
    <br/>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.<br/>
    <br/>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br/>
    <br/>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.<br/>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br/>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.<br/>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br/>3. REQUIREMENTS<br/>
    <br/>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:<br/>
    <br/>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br/>b) its license agreement:<br/>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<br/>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br/>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br/>iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.<br/>When the Program is made available in source code form:<br/>
    <br/>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br/>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.<br/>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.<br/>
    <br/>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.<br/>
    <br/>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br/>
    <br/>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br/>
    <br/>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.<br/>
    <br/>5. NO WARRANTY<br/>
    <br/>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br/>
    <br/>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br/>
    <br/>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
    <br/>7. GENERAL<br/>
    <br/>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br/>
    <br/>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/>
    <br/>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br/>
    <br/>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.<br/>

Usage Of Content

THE ECLIPSE FOUNDATION MAKES AVAILABLE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION AND/OR OTHER MATERIALS FOR OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS (COLLECTIVELY "CONTENT"). USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW. BY USING THE CONTENT, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE CONTENT.

Applicable Licenses

Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the Eclipse Foundation is provided to you under the terms and conditions of the Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 ("EPL"). A copy of the EPL is provided with this Content and is also available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html. For purposes of the EPL, "Program" will mean the Content.

Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object code, documentation and other files maintained in the Eclipse Foundation source code repository ("Repository") in software modules ("Modules") and made available as downloadable archives ("Downloads").

Content may be structured and packaged into modules to facilitate delivering, extending, and upgrading the Content. Typical modules may include plug-ins ("Plug-ins"), plug-in fragments ("Fragments"), and features ("Features").
Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or JAR (Java&trade; ARchive) in a directory named "plugins".
A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and associated material. Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory in a directory named "features". Within a Feature, files named "feature.xml" may contain a list of the names and version numbers of the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with that Feature.
Features may also include other Features ("Included Features"). Within a Feature, files named "feature.xml" may contain a list of the names and version numbers of Included Features.
The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be contained in files named "about.html" ("Abouts"). The terms and conditions governing Features and Included Features should be contained in files named "license.html" ("Feature Licenses"). Abouts and Feature Licenses may be located in any directory of a Download or Module including, but not limited to the following locations:

The top-level (root) directory
Plug-in and Fragment directories
Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs
Sub-directories of the directory named "src" of certain Plug-ins
Feature directories
Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is installed using the Provisioning Technology (as defined below), you must agree to a license ("Feature Update License") during the installation process. If the Feature contains Included Features, the Feature Update License should either provide you with the terms and conditions governing the Included Features or inform you where you can locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be found in the "license" property of files named "feature.properties" found within a Feature. Such Abouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms and conditions (or references to such terms and conditions) that govern your use of the associated Content in that directory.

THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY REFER TO THE EPL OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS. SOME OF THESE OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO):

Eclipse Distribution License Version 1.0 (available at http://www.eclipse.org/licenses/edl-v1.0.html)
Common Public License Version 1.0 (available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html)
Apache Software License 1.1 (available at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE)
Apache Software License 2.0 (available at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
Metro Link Public License 1.00 (available at http://www.opengroup.org/openmotif/supporters/metrolink/license.html)
Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (available at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html)
IT IS YOUR OBLIGATION TO READ AND ACCEPT ALL SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS PRIOR TO USE OF THE CONTENT. If no About, Feature License, or Feature Update License is provided, please contact the Eclipse Foundation to determine what terms and conditions govern that particular Content.

Use of Provisioning Technology

The Eclipse Foundation makes available provisioning software, examples of which include, but are not limited to, p2 and the Eclipse Update Manager ("Provisioning Technology") for the purpose of allowing users to install software, documentation, information and/or other materials (collectively "Installable Software"). This capability is provided with the intent of allowing such users to install, extend and update Eclipse-based products. Information about packaging Installable Software is available at http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html ("Specification").

You may use Provisioning Technology to allow other parties to install Installable Software. You shall be responsible for enabling the applicable license agreements relating to the Installable Software to be presented to, and accepted by, the users of the Provisioning Technology in accordance with the Specification. By using Provisioning Technology in such a manner and making it available in accordance with the Specification, you further acknowledge your agreement to, and the acquisition of all necessary rights to permit the following:

A series of actions may occur ("Provisioning Process") in which a user may execute the Provisioning Technology on a machine ("Target Machine") with the intent of installing, extending or updating the functionality of an Eclipse-based product.
During the Provisioning Process, the Provisioning Technology may cause third party Installable Software or a portion thereof to be accessed and copied to the Target Machine.
Pursuant to the Specification, you will provide to the user the terms and conditions that govern the use of the Installable Software ("Installable Software Agreement") and such Installable Software Agreement shall be accessed from the Target Machine in accordance with the Specification. Such Installable Software Agreement must inform the user of the terms and conditions that govern the Installable Software and must solicit acceptance by the end user in the manner prescribed in such Installable Software Agreement. Upon such indication of agreement by the user, the provisioning Technology will complete installation of the Installable Software.
Cryptography

Content may contain encryption software. The country in which you are currently may have restrictions on the import, possession, and use, and/or re-export to another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any encryption software, please check the country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to see if this is permitted.

    <strong>License(s):&nbsp;</strong>SIL Open Font License<br/>
    <strong>License text(s):&nbsp;</strong>
    <br/>This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.<br/>This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:<br/>http://scripts.sil.org/OFL<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
    <br/>PREAMBLE<br/>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br/>development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br/>efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br/>open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br/>with others.<br/>
    <br/>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br/>redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br/>fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, <br/>redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br/>names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br/>however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br/>requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br/>to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<br/>
    <br/>DEFINITIONS<br/>"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright<br/>Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may<br/>include source files, build scripts and documentation.<br/>
    <br/>"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the<br/>copyright statement(s).<br/>
    <br/>"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as<br/>distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).<br/>
    <br/>"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,<br/>or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the<br/>Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a<br/>new environment.<br/>
    <br/>"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical<br/>writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.<br/>
    <br/>PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS<br/>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br/>a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,<br/>redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font<br/>Software, subject to the following conditions:<br/>
    <br/>1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,<br/>in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.<br/>
    <br/>2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,<br/>redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy<br/>contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be<br/>included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or<br/>in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or<br/>binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.<br/>
    <br/>3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font<br/>Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding<br/>Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as<br/>presented to the users.<br/>
    <br/>4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font<br/>Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any<br/>Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the<br/>Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written<br/>permission.<br/>
    <br/>5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,<br/>must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be<br/>distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to<br/>remain under this license does not apply to any document created<br/>using the Font Software.<br/>
    <br/>TERMINATION<br/>This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are<br/>not met.<br/>
    <br/>DISCLAIMER<br/>THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,<br/>EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF<br/>MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT<br/>OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE<br/>COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,<br/>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL<br/>DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING<br/>FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM<br/>OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.<br/>

SOFTWARE RIGHTS

ANTLR 1989-2006 Developed by Terence Parr
Partially supported by University of San Francisco &amp; jGuru.com

We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the
public domain. An individual or company may do whatever
they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the
code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of
ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.

We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,
we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or
incorporate any source code into one of your programs
(commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that
you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this
system and expect to make other tools available as they are
completed.

    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.<br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>
    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/>

    <br/>2. License Grants and Conditions<br/>
    <br/>2.1. Grants<br/>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:<br/>
    <br/>under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and<br/>
    <br/>under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.<br/>
    <br/>2.2. Effective Date<br/>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.<br/>
    <br/>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope<br/>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:<br/>
    <br/>for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or<br/>
    <br/>for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or<br/>
    <br/>under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.<br/>
    <br/>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br/>
    <br/>2.4. Subsequent Licenses<br/>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).<br/>
    <br/>2.5. Representation<br/>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.<br/>
    <br/>2.6. Fair Use<br/>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.<br/>
    <br/>2.7. Conditions<br/>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.<br/>
    <br/>3. Responsibilities<br/>
    <br/>3.1. Distribution of Source Form<br/>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.<br/>
    <br/>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br/>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br/>
    <br/>such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<br/>
    <br/>You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.<br/>
    <br/>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br/>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).<br/>
    <br/>3.4. Notices<br/>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<br/>
    <br/>3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br/>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.<br/>
    <br/>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<br/>
    <br/>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br/>
    <br/>5. Termination<br/>
    <br/>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.<br/>
    <br/>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.<br/>
    <br/>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.<br/>
    <br/>6. Disclaimer of Warranty<br/>
    <br/>Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.<br/>
    <br/>7. Limitation of Liability<br/>
    <br/>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.<br/>
    <br/>8. Litigation<br/>
    <br/>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.<br/>
    <br/>9. Miscellaneous<br/>
    <br/>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.<br/>
    <br/>10. Versions of the License<br/>
    <br/>10.1. New Versions<br/>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.<br/>
    <br/>10.2. Effect of New Versions<br/>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.<br/>
    <br/>10.3. Modified Versions<br/>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).<br/>
    <br/>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses<br/>If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.<br/>
    <br/>Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice<br/>

    <br/>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
    <br/>Version 2.1, February 1999<br/>
    <br/>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br/>51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br/>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
    <br/>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br/> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br/> the version number 2.1.]<br/>Preamble<br/>
    <br/>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br/>
    <br/>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br/>
    <br/>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.<br/>
    <br/>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br/>
    <br/>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br/>
    <br/>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br/>
    <br/>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.<br/>
    <br/>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br/>
    <br/>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br/>
    <br/>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.<br/>
    <br/>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br/>
    <br/>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br/>
    <br/>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.<br/>
    <br/>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br/>
    <br/>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br/>
    <br/>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br/>
    <br/>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br/>
    <br/>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br/>
    <br/>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br/>
    <br/>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br/>
    <br/>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.<br/>
    <br/>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.<br/>
    <br/>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br/>
    <br/>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
    <br/>a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br/>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br/>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br/>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br/>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)<br/>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br/>
    <br/>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br/>
    <br/>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br/>
    <br/>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br/>
    <br/>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br/>
    <br/>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br/>
    <br/>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br/>
    <br/>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br/>
    <br/>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br/>
    <br/>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br/>
    <br/>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br/>
    <br/>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br/>
    <br/>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br/>
    <br/>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br/>
    <br/>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br/>
    <br/>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)<br/>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br/>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.<br/>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br/>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br/>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<br/>
    <br/>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.<br/>
    <br/>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br/>
    <br/>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.<br/>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br/>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br/>
    <br/>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br/>
    <br/>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br/>
    <br/>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br/>
    <br/>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br/>
    <br/>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br/>
    <br/>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br/>
    <br/>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br/>
    <br/>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br/>
    <br/>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br/>
    <br/>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br/>
    <br/>NO WARRANTY<br/>
    <br/>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/>
    <br/>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<hr/>

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *

*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *

*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *

*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

*                                                                      *
************************************************************************

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

licensing arrangement has been endorsed by the contributor, and it is
therefore unnecessary to ask the contributor again to confirm it.

I have not asked any contributors (or their employers, if they have them) for
proofs that they have the right to distribute their software in this way.

ABSTRACT
========

   UPX and UCL are copyrighted software distributed under the terms
   of the GNU General Public License (hereinafter the "GPL").

   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part
   of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The
   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing
   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.

   As a special exception we grant the free usage of UPX for all
   executables, including commercial programs.
   See below for details and restrictions.


COPYRIGHT
=========

   UPX and UCL are copyrighted software. All rights remain with the authors.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
==========================

   UPX and the UCL library are free software; you can redistribute them
   and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
   published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of
   the License, or (at your option) any later version.

   UPX and UCL are distributed in the hope that they will be useful,
   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
   GNU General Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
   along with this program; see the file COPYING.


SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR COMPRESSED EXECUTABLES
============================================

   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part
   of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The
   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing
   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.

   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special
   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs
   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:

   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX
      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)
      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as
      distributed by us.
   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.
      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical
      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.
   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get
      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at
      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,
      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.


ANNOTATIONS
===========

  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for
    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.

  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX
    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,
    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your
    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to
    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.

  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use
    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we
    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects
    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -
    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious
    by definition.

  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that
    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant
    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.

  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and
    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to
    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.

Subject to any third party claims, Silicon Graphics, Inc. ("SGI") hereby
grants permission to Recipient (defined below), under Recipient's copyrights
in the Original Software (defined below), to use, copy, modify, merge,
publish, distribute, sublicense and/or sell copies of Subject Software
(defined below), and to permit persons to whom the Subject Software is
furnished in accordance with this License to do the same, subject to all of
the following terms and conditions, which Recipient accepts by engaging in any
such use, copying, modifying, merging, publishing, distributing, sublicensing
or selling:

1. Definitions.

    or structure of either the Original Software or any previous
    Modifications. When Subject Software is released as a series of files, a
    Modification means (i) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a
    file containing Original Software or previous Modifications and (ii) any
    new file that contains any part of the Original Code or previous
    Modifications.

    (c) "Subject Software" means the Original Software or Modifications or the
    combination of the Original Software and Modifications, or portions of any
    of the foregoing.

    (d) "Recipient" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
    under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
    entities, "Recipient" includes any entity which controls, is controlled

    definition, "control" of an entity means (a) the power, direct or
    indirect, to direct or manage such entity, or (b) ownership of fifty
    percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of
    such entity.

2. Redistribution of Source Code Subject to These Terms. Redistributions of
Subject Software in source code form must retain the notice set forth in
Exhibit A, below, in every file. A copy of this License must be included in
any documentation for such Subject Software where the recipients' rights
relating to Subject Software are described. Recipient may distribute the
source code version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's choice,
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that (i)
Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the
license terms include this Section 2 and Sections 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of
this License, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other terms
of such license. If Recipient distributes the source code version under a
different license Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, not by SGI. Recipient
hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result
of any such terms Recipient offers.

3. Redistribution in Executable Form. The notice set forth in Exhibit A must
be conspicuously included in any notice in an executable version of Subject
Software, related documentation or collateral in which Recipient describes the
user's rights relating to the Subject Software. Recipient may distribute the
executable version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's choice,
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that (i)
Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the
license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of
this License, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other terms
of such license. If Recipient distributes the executable version under a
different license Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, not by SGI. Recipient
hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result
of any such terms Recipient offers.

4. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if Recipient fails to comply with terms herein and fails to cure
such breach within 30 days of the breach. Any sublicense to the Subject
Software which is properly granted shall survive any termination of this
License absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions which,
by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
shall survive.

5. No Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use any
trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever. No trade name, trademark or
service mark of SGI may be used to endorse or promote products derived from
the Subject Software without prior written permission of SGI.

6. No Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights with respect to the
OpenGL API or to any software or hardware implementation thereof or to any
other software whatsoever, nor shall any other rights or licenses not
expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise with
respect to the Subject Software. Title to and ownership of the Original
Software at all times remains with SGI. All rights in the Original Software
not expressly granted under this License are reserved.

7. Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. Recipient shall comply with all
applicable laws and regulations in connection with use and distribution of the
Subject Software, including but not limited to, all export and import control
laws and regulations of the U.S. government and other countries. Recipient may
not distribute Subject Software that (i) in any way infringes (directly or
contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade secret,
trademark or other intellectual property rights of any kind) of any other
person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express,
implied or statutory, which under any applicable law it might be deemed to
have been distributed.

8. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any one
or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, distribution,
import or sale of Subject Software (including particular functionality or code
incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the third party's intellectual
property rights, Recipient must place in a well-identified web page bearing
the title "LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a description of the
party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of the Subject
Software will know whom to contact regarding the claim. Also, upon gaining
such knowledge of any such claim, Recipient must conspicuously include the URL
for such web page in the Exhibit A notice required under Sections 2 and 3,
above, and in the text of any related documentation, license agreement or
collateral in which Recipient describes end user's rights relating to the
Subject Software. If Recipient obtains such knowledge after it makes Subject
Software available to any other person or entity, Recipient shall take other
steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
calculated to inform those who received the Subject Software that new
knowledge has been obtained.

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON- INFRINGING. SGI ASSUMES NO
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD ANY SOFTWARE
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI ASSUMES NO COST OR LIABILITY FOR ANY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY),
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.

11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising,
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License.
Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc. from
and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses (including the
payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Recipient's use,
modification, reproduction and distribution of the Subject Software or out of
any representation or warranty made by Recipient.

12. U.S. Government End Users. The Subject Software is a "commercial item"
consisting of "commercial computer software" as such terms are defined in
title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations and all U.S. Government End Users
acquire only the rights set forth in this License and are subject to the terms
of this License.

13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed so as to achieve as nearly as
possible the same economic effect as the original provision and the remainder
of this License will remain in effect. This License shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of
California as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely
within California between California residents. Any litigation relating to
this License shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal
Courts of the Northern District of California (or, absent subject matter
jurisdiction in such courts, the courts of the State of California), with
venue lying exclusively in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing
party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the third party's intellectual
property rights, Recipient must place in a well-identified web page bearing
the title "LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a description of the
party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of the Subject
Software will know whom to contact regarding the claim. Also, upon gaining
such knowledge of any such claim, Recipient must conspicuously include the URL
for such web page in the Required Notice, and in the text of any related
documentation, license agreement or collateral in which Recipient describes
end user's rights relating to the Subject Software. If Recipient obtains such
knowledge after it makes Subject Software available to any other person or
entity, Recipient shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to provide such knowledge
to those who received the Subject Software.

DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE OR
THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT

directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License.
Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold SGI and its successors and assigns

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    <br/>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<br/>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br/>i) changes to the Program, and<br/>ii) additions to the Program;<br/>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.<br/>"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.<br/>
    <br/>"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.<br/>
    <br/>"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.<br/>
    <br/>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.<br/>
    <br/>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br/>
    <br/>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.<br/>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br/>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.<br/>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br/>3. REQUIREMENTS<br/>
    <br/>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:<br/>
    <br/>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br/>b) its license agreement:<br/>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<br/>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br/>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br/>iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.<br/>When the Program is made available in source code form:<br/>
    <br/>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br/>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.<br/>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.<br/>
    <br/>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.<br/>
    <br/>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br/>
    <br/>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br/>
    <br/>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.<br/>
    <br/>5. NO WARRANTY<br/>
    <br/>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br/>
    <br/>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br/>
    <br/>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
    <br/>7. GENERAL<br/>
    <br/>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br/>
    <br/>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/>
    <br/>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br/>
    <br/>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.<br/>
    <br/>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.<br/>

    <br/>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
    <br/>Version 3, 29 June 2007<br/>
    <br/>Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br/>
    <br/>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
    <br/>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br/>
    <br/>0. Additional Definitions.<br/>As used herein, &ldquo;this License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the &ldquo;GNU GPL&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br/>
    <br/>&ldquo;The Library&rdquo; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br/>
    <br/>An &ldquo;Application&rdquo; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.<br/>
    <br/>A &ldquo;Combined Work&rdquo; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &ldquo;Linked Version&rdquo;.<br/>
    <br/>The &ldquo;Minimal Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br/>
    <br/>The &ldquo;Corresponding Application Code&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br/>
    <br/>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br/>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br/>
    <br/>2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br/>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:<br/>
    <br/>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br/>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.<br/>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br/>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br/>
    <br/>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.<br/>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br/>4. Combined Works.<br/>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:<br/>
    <br/>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.<br/>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br/>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br/>d) Do one of the following:<br/>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.<br/>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.<br/>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br/>5. Combined Libraries.<br/>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:<br/>
    <br/>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.<br/>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br/>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br/>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br/>
    <br/>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br/>
    <br/>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.<br/>

    <pre>JFreeChart has the following dependencies:

(a)  JDK 1.3.1 or higher - JFreeChart requires the Java2D and Collections
APIs, so it definitely won't work with JDK 1.1 (with a small amount of effort
you can probably get it to compile and run with JDK 1.2).  If you are using
JFreeChart to create applets, this means that you cannot rely on the JVM
integrated with Microsoft's Internet Explorer - your users will need to have
the Java 2 plug-in installed.  Most other browsers (e.g. Firefox, Safari and
Chrome) offer good support for modern JREs.

(b)  JCommon - version 1.0.0 or later.  The runtime jar file (version 1.0.17)
is included in the JFreeChart distribution.  You can obtain the complete
source code for JCommon from:

    http://www.jfree.org/jcommon/

JCommon is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public Licence.

(c)  GNU JAXP (JDK 1.3 only) - a free implementation of the standard XML 
processing APIs for Java.

    http://www.gnu.org/software/classpathx/jaxp/

Classes in the org.jfree.data.xml package require this library, or
another JAXP v1.1 compliant parser.  The gnujaxp.jar file (from the
gnujaxp-1.0beta1.zip distribution) is included with JFreeChart.  GNU
JAXP is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
with an additional library exception.

THIS LIBRARY IS ONLY REQUIRED BY JFREECHART IF YOU ARE USING JDK 1.3.

(d)  servlet.jar - classes in the org.jfree.chart.servlet
package require this file.  The JFreeChart distribution includes the 
servlet.jar file distributed with Tomcat 4.1.31.  Applicable license 
terms are published at:

    <br/>      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,<br/>      including but not limited to software source code, documentation<br/>      source, and configuration files.<br/>
    <br/>      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical<br/>      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but<br/>      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,<br/>      and conversions to other media types.<br/>
    <br/>      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br/>      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br/>      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br/>      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br/>
    <br/>      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br/>      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br/>      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br/>      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br/>      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br/>      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br/>      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br/>
    <br/>      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br/>      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br/>      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br/>      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br/>      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br/>      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<br/>      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br/>      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br/>      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br/>      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br/>      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<br/>      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise<br/>      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br/>
    <br/>      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br/>      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br/>      subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br/>
    <br/>   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br/>      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br/>      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br/>      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br/>
    <br/>   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br/>      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br/>      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br/>      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br/>      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br/>      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br/>      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br/>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br/>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/>
    <br/>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br/>      meet the following conditions:<br/>
    <br/>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br/>
    <br/>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>          stating that You changed the files; and<br/>
    <br/>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>          the Derivative Works; and<br/>
    <br/>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/>          as modifying the License.<br/>
    <br/>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>      the conditions stated in this License.<br/>
    <br/>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>
    <br/>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/>
    <br/>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/>
    <br/>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/>
    <br/>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/>
    <br/>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
    <br/>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br/>
    <br/>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br/>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br/>      replaced with your own identifying information.

    <br/>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>
    <br/>   6. Trademarks.

For the purposes<br/>      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br/>      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br/>      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br/>

    <br/>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/>          as modifying the License.<br/>
    <br/>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>      the conditions stated in this License.<br/>
    <br/>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>
    <br/>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/>
    <br/>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/>
    <br/>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/>
    <br/>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/>
    <br/>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
    <br/>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>Eclipse Public License - v 1.0<br/>
    <br/>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br/>
    <br/>1. DEFINITIONS<br/>
    <br/>"Contribution" means:<br/>
    <br/>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<br/>
    <br/>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br/>
    <br/>i) changes to the Program, and<br/>
    <br/>ii) additions to the Program;<br/>
    <br/>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.<br/>
    <br/>"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.<br/>
    <br/>"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.<br/>
    <br/>"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.<br/>
    <br/>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.<br/>
    <br/>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br/>
    <br/>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.<br/>
    <br/>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br/>
    <br/>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.<br/>
    <br/>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br/>
    <br/>3. REQUIREMENTS<br/>
    <br/>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:<br/>
    <br/>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br/>
    <br/>b) its license agreement:<br/>
    <br/>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<br/>
    <br/>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br/>
    <br/>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br/>
    <br/>iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.<br/>
    <br/>When the Program is made available in source code form:<br/>
    <br/>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br/>
    <br/>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.<br/>
    <br/>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.<br/>
    <br/>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.<br/>
    <br/>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br/>
    <br/>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br/>
    <br/>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.<br/>
    <br/>5. NO WARRANTY<br/>
    <br/>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br/>
    <br/>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br/>
    <br/>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
    <br/>7. GENERAL<br/>
    <br/>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br/>
    <br/>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/>
    <br/>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br/>
    <br/>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.<br/>
    <br/>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.<br/>

    <br/>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<br/>non-exclusive license:<br/>
    <br/>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)<br/>    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,<br/>    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its<br/>    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or<br/>    as part of a Larger Work; and<br/>
    <br/>(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer<br/>    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its<br/>    Contributions or its Contributor Version.<br/>
    <br/>2.2. Effective Date<br/>
    <br/>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution<br/>become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first<br/>distributes such Contribution.<br/>
    <br/>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope<br/>
    <br/>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under<br/>this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the<br/>distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.<br/>Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a<br/>Contributor:<br/>
    <br/>(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;<br/>    or<br/>
    <br/>(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's<br/>    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its<br/>    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor<br/>    Version); or<br/>
    <br/>(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of<br/>    its Contributions.<br/>
    <br/>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,<br/>or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with<br/>the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br/>
    <br/>2.4. Subsequent Licenses<br/>
    <br/>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to<br/>distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this<br/>License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if<br/>permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).<br/>
    <br/>2.5. Representation<br/>
    <br/>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its<br/>Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights<br/>to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.<br/>
    <br/>2.6. Fair Use<br/>
    <br/>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under<br/>applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other<br/>equivalents.<br/>
    <br/>2.7. Conditions<br/>
    <br/>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted<br/>in Section 2.1.<br/>
    <br/>3. Responsibilities<br/>-------------------<br/>
    <br/>3.1. Distribution of Source Form<br/>
    <br/>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any<br/>Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under<br/>the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source<br/>Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this<br/>License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not<br/>attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code<br/>Form.<br/>
    <br/>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br/>
    <br/>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br/>
    <br/>(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code<br/>    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of<br/>    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code<br/>    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more<br/>    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<br/>
    <br/>(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this<br/>    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the<br/>    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter<br/>    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.<br/>
    <br/>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br/>
    <br/>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,<br/>provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for<br/>the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered<br/>Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the<br/>Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this<br/>License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software<br/>under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of<br/>the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered<br/>Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary<br/>License(s).<br/>
    <br/>3.4. Notices<br/>
    <br/>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices<br/>(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,<br/>or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of<br/>the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to<br/>the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<br/>
    <br/>3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br/>
    <br/>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,<br/>indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered<br/>Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br/>behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any<br/>such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by<br/>You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any<br/>liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<br/>indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional<br/>disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any<br/>jurisdiction.<br/>
    <br/>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/>
    <br/>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br/>License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to<br/>statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br/>the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br/>describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must<br/>be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered<br/>Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute<br/>or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a<br/>recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br/>
    <br/>5. Termination<br/>--------------<br/>
    <br/>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically<br/>if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become<br/>compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular<br/>Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such<br/>Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an<br/>ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the<br/>non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have<br/>come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular<br/>Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor<br/>notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the<br/>first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License<br/>from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after<br/>Your receipt of the notice.<br/>
    <br/>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent<br/>infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,<br/>counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version<br/>directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to<br/>You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section<br/>2.1 of this License shall terminate.<br/>
    <br/>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all<br/>end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which<br/>have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License<br/>prior to termination shall survive termination.<br/>

The entire risk as to the     *<br/>*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *<br/>*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *<br/>*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *<br/>*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *<br/>*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *<br/>*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *<br/>*                                                                      *<br/>************************************************************************<br/>
    <br/>************************************************************************<br/>*                                                                      *<br/>*  7.

This   *<br/>*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *<br/>*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *<br/>*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *<br/>*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *<br/>*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *<br/>*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *<br/>*                                                                      *<br/>************************************************************************<br/>
    <br/>8. Litigation<br/>-------------<br/>
    <br/>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the<br/>courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal<br/>place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that<br/>jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.<br/>Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring<br/>cross-claims or counter-claims.<br/>
    <br/>9. Miscellaneous<br/>----------------<br/>
    <br/>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject<br/>matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br/>unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br/>necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides<br/>that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter<br/>shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.<br/>
    <br/>10. Versions of the License<br/>---------------------------<br/>
    <br/>10.1. New Versions<br/>
    <br/>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section<br/>10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or<br/>publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a<br/>distinguishing version number.<br/>
    <br/>10.2. Effect of New Versions<br/>

    <br/>10.3. Modified Versions<br/>
    <br/>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to<br/>create a new license for such software, you may create and use a<br/>modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove<br/>any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that<br/>such modified license differs from this License).<br/>

    <br/>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>

    <br/>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/>

You are solely responsible for determining the <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks <br/>associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/>

    <br/>      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br/>      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br/>      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br/>      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br/>      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br/>      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br/>      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br/>
    <br/>      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br/>      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br/>      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br/>      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br/>      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br/>      the copyright owner.

Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br/>      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br/>      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br/>      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br/>
    <br/>   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br/>      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br/>      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br/>      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br/>      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br/>      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br/>      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br/>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br/>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/>
    <br/>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br/>      meet the following conditions:<br/>
    <br/>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br/>
    <br/>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>          stating that You changed the files; and<br/>
    <br/>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>          the Derivative Works; and<br/>
    <br/>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/>          as modifying the License.<br/>
    <br/>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>      the conditions stated in this License.<br/>
    <br/>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>
    <br/>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/>
    <br/>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/>
    <br/>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/>
    <br/>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/>
    <br/>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>

    <br/>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br/>
    <br/>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br/>
    <br/>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.<br/>
    <br/>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br/>
    <br/>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br/>
    <br/>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br/>
    <br/>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.<br/>
    <br/>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br/>
    <br/>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br/>
    <br/>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.<br/>
    <br/>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br/>
    <br/>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br/>
    <br/>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.<br/>
    <br/>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br/>
    <br/>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br/>
    <br/>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br/>
    <br/>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br/>
    <br/>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br/>
    <br/>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br/>
    <br/>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br/>
    <br/>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.<br/>
    <br/>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.<br/>
    <br/>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br/>
    <br/>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
    <br/>a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br/>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br/>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br/>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br/>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)<br/>
    <br/>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br/>
    <br/>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br/>
    <br/>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br/>
    <br/>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br/>
    <br/>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br/>
    <br/>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br/>
    <br/>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br/>
    <br/>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br/>
    <br/>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br/>
    <br/>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br/>
    <br/>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br/>
    <br/>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br/>
    <br/>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br/>
    <br/>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br/>
    <br/>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br/>
    <br/>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)<br/>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br/>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.<br/>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br/>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br/>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<br/>
    <br/>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.<br/>
    <br/>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br/>
    <br/>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.<br/>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br/>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br/>
    <br/>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br/>
    <br/>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br/>
    <br/>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br/>
    <br/>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br/>
    <br/>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br/>
    <br/>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br/>
    <br/>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br/>
    <br/>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br/>
    <br/>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br/>
    <br/>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br/>
    <br/>NO WARRANTY<br/>
    <br/>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/>
    <br/>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>

    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.<br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>
    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/>

You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/>
    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/>
    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/>

    <br/>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
    <br/>Version 2.1, February 1999<br/>
    <br/>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br/>51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br/>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
    <br/>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br/> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br/> the version number 2.1.]<br/>Preamble<br/>
    <br/>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br/>
    <br/>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br/>
    <br/>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.<br/>
    <br/>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br/>
    <br/>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br/>
    <br/>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br/>
    <br/>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.<br/>
    <br/>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br/>
    <br/>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br/>
    <br/>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.<br/>
    <br/>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br/>
    <br/>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br/>
    <br/>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.<br/>
    <br/>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br/>
    <br/>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br/>
    <br/>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br/>
    <br/>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br/>
    <br/>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br/>
    <br/>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br/>
    <br/>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br/>
    <br/>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.<br/>
    <br/>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.<br/>
    <br/>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br/>
    <br/>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
    <br/>a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br/>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br/>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br/>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br/>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)<br/>
    <br/>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br/>
    <br/>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br/>
    <br/>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br/>
    <br/>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br/>
    <br/>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br/>
    <br/>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br/>
    <br/>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br/>
    <br/>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br/>
    <br/>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br/>
    <br/>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br/>
    <br/>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br/>
    <br/>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br/>
    <br/>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br/>
    <br/>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br/>
    <br/>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br/>
    <br/>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)<br/>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br/>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.<br/>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br/>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br/>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<br/>
    <br/>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.<br/>
    <br/>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br/>
    <br/>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.<br/>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br/>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br/>
    <br/>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br/>
    <br/>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br/>
    <br/>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br/>
    <br/>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br/>
    <br/>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br/>
    <br/>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br/>
    <br/>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br/>
    <br/>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br/>
    <br/>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br/>
    <br/>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br/>
    <br/>NO WARRANTY<br/>
    <br/>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/>
    <br/>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>

Common Public License - v 1.0


THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.


1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i)	 changes to the Program, and
ii)	 additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.


"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.


"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.


"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.


2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a)	Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c)	Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d)	Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a)	it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b)	its license agreement:
i)	effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii)	states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
iv)	states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form:

a)	it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b)	a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.


Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.


4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.


For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.


5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 


6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.


If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.


All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. 


Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.


This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    <strong>License text(s):&nbsp;</strong>
    <br/>                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>                       Version 2.1, February 1999<br/>
    <br/> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br/> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
    <br/>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br/> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br/> the version number 2.1.]<br/>
    <br/>                            Preamble<br/>
    <br/>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br/>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br/>Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br/>free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br/>
    <br/>  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br/>specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br/>Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br/>can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br/>this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br/>strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br/>
    <br/>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br/>not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br/>you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br/>for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br/>it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br/>it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br/>these things.<br/>
    <br/>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br/>distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br/>rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br/>you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br/>
    <br/>  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br/>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br/>you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br/>code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br/>complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br/>with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br/>it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br/>
    <br/>  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br/>library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br/>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br/>
    <br/>  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br/>there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br/>modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br/>that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br/>author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br/>introduced by others.<br/>
    <br/>  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br/>any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br/>effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br/>restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br/>any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br/>consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br/>
    <br/>  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br/>ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br/>General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br/>is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br/>this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br/>libraries into non-free programs.<br/>
    <br/>  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br/>a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br/>combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br/>General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br/>entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br/>Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br/>the library.<br/>
    <br/>  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br/>does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br/>Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br/>of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br/>are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br/>libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br/>special circumstances.<br/>
    <br/>  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br/>encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br/>a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br/>allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br/>library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br/>case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br/>software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br/>
    <br/>  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br/>programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br/>free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br/>non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br/>operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br/>system.<br/>
    <br/>  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br/>users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br/>linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br/>that program using a modified version of the Library.<br/>
    <br/>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br/>modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br/>"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br/>former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br/>be combined with the library in order to run.<br/>
    <br/>                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br/>
    <br/>  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br/>program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br/>other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br/>this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br/>Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br/>
    <br/>  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br/>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br/>(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br/>
    <br/>  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br/>which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br/>Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br/>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br/>portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br/>straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br/>included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br/>
    <br/>  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br/>making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br/>all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br/>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br/>and installation of the library.<br/>
    <br/>  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br/>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br/>running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br/>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br/>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br/>writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br/>and what the program that uses the Library does.<br/>
    <br/>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br/>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br/>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br/>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br/>all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br/>warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br/>Library.<br/>
    <br/>  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br/>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br/>fee.<br/>
    <br/>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br/>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br/>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br/>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
    <br/>    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br/>
    <br/>    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br/>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br/>
    <br/>    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br/>    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br/>
    <br/>    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br/>    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br/>    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br/>    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br/>    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br/>    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br/>    its purpose remains meaningful.<br/>
    <br/>    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br/>    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br/>    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br/>    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br/>    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br/>    root function must still compute square roots.)<br/>
    <br/>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br/>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br/>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br/>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br/>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br/>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br/>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br/>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br/>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br/>it.<br/>
    <br/>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br/>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br/>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br/>collective works based on the Library.<br/>
    <br/>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br/>with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br/>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br/>the scope of this License.<br/>
    <br/>  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br/>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br/>this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br/>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br/>instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br/>ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br/>that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br/>these notices.<br/>
    <br/>  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br/>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br/>subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br/>
    <br/>  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br/>the Library into a program that is not a library.<br/>
    <br/>  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br/>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br/>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br/>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br/>must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br/>medium customarily used for software interchange.<br/>
    <br/>  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br/>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br/>source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br/>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br/>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br/>
    <br/>  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br/>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br/>linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br/>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br/>therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br/>
    <br/>  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br/>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br/>contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br/>library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br/>Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br/>
    <br/>  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br/>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br/>derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br/>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br/>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br/>threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br/>
    <br/>  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br/>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br/>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br/>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br/>work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br/>Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br/>
    <br/>  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br/>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br/>Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br/>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br/>
    <br/>  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br/>link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br/>work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br/>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br/>modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br/>engineering for debugging such modifications.<br/>
    <br/>  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br/>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br/>this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br/>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br/>copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br/>directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br/>of these things:<br/>
    <br/>    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br/>    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br/>    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br/>    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br/>    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br/>    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br/>    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br/>    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br/>    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br/>    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br/>    to use the modified definitions.)<br/>
    <br/>    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br/>    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br/>    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br/>    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br/>    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br/>    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br/>    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br/>
    <br/>    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br/>    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br/>    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br/>    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br/>
    <br/>    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br/>    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br/>    specified materials from the same place.<br/>
    <br/>    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br/>    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br/>
    <br/>  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br/>Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br/>reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br/>the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br/>normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br/>components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br/>which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br/>the executable.<br/>
    <br/>  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br/>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br/>accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br/>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br/>distribute.<br/>
    <br/>  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br/>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br/>facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br/>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br/>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br/>permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br/>
    <br/>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br/>    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br/>    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br/>    Sections above.<br/>
    <br/>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br/>    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br/>    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br/>
    <br/>  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br/>the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br/>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br/>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br/>rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br/>or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br/>terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br/>
    <br/>  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br/>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br/>distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br/>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br/>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br/>Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br/>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br/>the Library or works based on it.<br/>
    <br/>  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br/>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br/>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br/>subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br/>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br/>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br/>this License.<br/>
    <br/>  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br/>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br/>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br/>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br/>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br/>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br/>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br/>may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br/>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br/>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br/>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br/>refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br/>
    <br/>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br/>particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br/>and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br/>
    <br/>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br/>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br/>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br/>integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br/>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br/>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br/>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br/>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br/>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br/>impose that choice.<br/>
    <br/>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br/>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br/>
    <br/>  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br/>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br/>original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br/>an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br/>so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br/>excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br/>written in the body of this License.<br/>
    <br/>  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br/>versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br/>Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br/>but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br/>
    <br/>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br/>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br/>"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br/>conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br/>the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br/>license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br/>the Free Software Foundation.<br/>
    <br/>  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br/>programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br/>write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br/>copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br/>Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br/>decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br/>of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br/>and reuse of software generally.<br/>
    <br/>                            NO WARRANTY<br/>
    <br/>  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br/>WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br/>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br/>OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br/>KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br/>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br/>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br/>LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br/>THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/>
    <br/>  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br/>WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br/>AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br/>FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br/>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br/>LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br/>RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br/>FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br/>SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br/>DAMAGES.<br/>
    <br/>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<hr/>

    <br/>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
    <br/>Version 2.1, February 1999<br/>
    <br/>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br/>51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br/>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
    <br/>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br/> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br/> the version number 2.1.]<br/>Preamble<br/>
    <br/>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br/>
    <br/>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br/>
    <br/>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.<br/>
    <br/>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br/>
    <br/>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br/>
    <br/>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br/>
    <br/>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.<br/>
    <br/>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br/>
    <br/>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br/>
    <br/>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.<br/>
    <br/>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br/>
    <br/>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br/>
    <br/>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.<br/>
    <br/>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br/>
    <br/>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br/>
    <br/>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br/>
    <br/>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br/>
    <br/>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br/>
    <br/>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br/>
    <br/>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br/>
    <br/>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.<br/>
    <br/>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.<br/>
    <br/>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br/>
    <br/>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
    <br/>a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br/>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br/>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br/>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br/>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)<br/>
    <br/>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br/>
    <br/>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br/>
    <br/>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br/>
    <br/>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br/>
    <br/>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br/>
    <br/>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br/>
    <br/>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br/>
    <br/>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br/>
    <br/>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br/>
    <br/>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br/>
    <br/>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br/>
    <br/>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br/>
    <br/>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br/>
    <br/>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br/>
    <br/>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br/>
    <br/>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)<br/>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br/>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.<br/>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br/>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br/>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<br/>
    <br/>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.<br/>
    <br/>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br/>
    <br/>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.<br/>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br/>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br/>
    <br/>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br/>
    <br/>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br/>
    <br/>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br/>
    <br/>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br/>
    <br/>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br/>
    <br/>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br/>
    <br/>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br/>
    <br/>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br/>
    <br/>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br/>
    <br/>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br/>
    <br/>NO WARRANTY<br/>
    <br/>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/>
    <br/>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
