1 Maintenance
A common perception of maintenance is that it merely involves fixing defects. However, over 80%, of the maintenance effort typically deals with non-corrective issues. Users often submit problem reports which, in reality, point out needed functionality enhancements, and thus are in effect change requests. 

The Maintenance space contains a default set of pages that report various metrics and statistics about maintenance issues.

* [Issues Trend>Issues Trend] - Trend charts of issue reported and fixed in last months.
* [Fix Time>Fix Time] - The graph shows number of issues fixed in NUM weeks after the creation. I.e. items where ResolvedOn-CreatedOn = X weeks
