    <field id="description" text-type="text/html">You need to plan Versions that correspond to releases. Also plan Iterations, which are essentially milestones within each Version. (Create Time Points in Polarion for each Iteration.) For each Iteration, you should decide which requirements are to be addressed and link these to one or more Work Package items. You will end up with a collection of Work Packages representing the development work to be done for each Iteration, and by extension, each Version. Several pages in the Development space can help with these activities.</field>
